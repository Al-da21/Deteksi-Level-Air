ðŸ’§ Water Level Detection in Storage Tanks
ðŸ“Œ Overview
This system is designed to detect water levels in storage tanks using computer vision. It classifies the water condition into four categories: Full, Half, Low, and Empty. Built with YOLOv8, the model is capable of detecting water levels from images or video frames. A simple web-based interface using Flask allows users to upload media and view detection results directly.
